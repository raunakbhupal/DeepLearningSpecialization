# DeepLearningSpecialization

This repo consists of the codes of the Deep Learning Specialization course which I took on Coursera

## Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks:Hyperparameter Tuning,Regularization and Optimization

## Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks 

## Course 5: Sequence Models
Portion of codes needs to be updated in course 5
